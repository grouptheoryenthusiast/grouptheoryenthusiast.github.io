I am a PhD student in Pure Mathematics (Group Theory) in the UK.
I am interested in the combination of mathematics and computing to solve difficult problems.
In particular I am very interested in Computational Group Theory, where mathematical insight and powerful theorems must be combined with good algorithm design. 

I have recently been studying Bioinformatics, and am enjoying it for the same reasons - mathematical insight and good algorithms combined to solve interesting problems.

### More Information

I will soon be finishing my PhD and thinking about jobs and Post Docs (scary!). If you are interested in working together please feel free to contact me.
